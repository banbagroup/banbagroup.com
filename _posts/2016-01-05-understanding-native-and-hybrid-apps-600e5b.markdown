excerpt: "Known for its sleek and simple design, iOS uses multi-touch gestures, which is based on the concept of direct manipulation Interface. Its control elements consist of switches, buttons and sliders. Moreover, interaction with the operating system includes gestures such as swipe, tap, and pinch all of which have specific definitions in the context of the iOS and its multi-touch interface."

<h2>Native</h2>

<p>&nbsp;<u>What is iOS?</u></p>

<p>&nbsp;iOS, originally iPhone OS is Apple&rsquo;s proprietary mobile operating system and it is only distributed exclusively for Apple products such as the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Based on the Macintosh OS X, iOS was first introduced back in January of 2007 alongside the original iPhone.</p>

<p>Known for its sleek and simple design, iOS uses multi-touch gestures, which is based on the concept of direct manipulation Interface. Its control elements consist of switches, buttons and sliders. Moreover, interaction with the operating system includes gestures such as swipe, tap, and pinch all of which have specific definitions in the context of the iOS and its multi-touch interface.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<u>What is android?</u></p>

<p>Android is the operating system developed by Google. It was initially released on September 23, 2008. It is commonly installed on a variety of tablets and smartphones. Android phones are highly customisable and can be altered to meet your preferences and needs which can completely change the look of your device&#39;s interface. It provides the ability to change the default launcher, and hence the appearance and externally visible behaviour of Android. These appearance changes include a no dock or multi-page dock, and many more changes to fundamental features such as themes and the wallpaper of the user interface</p>

<p>Android&#39;s user interface is also mainly based on the concept of direct manipulation similar to that of iOS. It uses touch gestures that correspond to real-time actions, such as pinching, swiping and tapping to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard to input texts.</p>

<h2>Hybrid</h2>

<p><u>Apache Cordova</u></p>

<p>Apache Cordova, initially known, as Phonegap is an open-source mobile application development framework. Originally created by Nitombi, Adobe Systems is now the&nbsp;licensed&nbsp;owner of it.</p>

<p>Instead of relying on platform-specific APIs like those in Android, iOS, or Windows Phone, Apache Cordova provides software programmers with the opportunity to build applications for mobile devices using programming languages such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The resulting applications developed on Apache Cordova are hybrid, i.e. that they are not truly native mobile application as opposed to those in iOS and Android not are they purely Web-based as it enables wrapping up of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code depending upon the platform of the device and extends the features of JavaScript and HTML to work with the device.</p>

<p>Apache Cordova can be a very useful tool for mobile application developers who want to extend their application across more than one platform, without having to re-implement it with each platform&#39;s language. Also, they can mix native application components with a WebView that can access device-level APIs and can also help to develop a plugin interface between WebView and the native components.</p>

<p><u>Framework7</u></p>

<p>Framework7 is a free and open source mobile application and web app development framework. It easily helps create Android and iOS applications with Javascript, CSS and HTML. It focuses more on iOS and Google material design to provide with simplicity and the best experience.</p>

<p>Designed inspired by the official Google Material design specification, Framework7 Material theme brings pixel-perfect material features like visual design, interactions, colours, and effects. But what makes Framework7 stand out is that unlike other framework, Framework7 it is very easy if you want to create iOS apps as it doesn&#39;t force you to write custom tags that will be converted by JavaScript to something else and describe all your content in JavaScript. It just requires you to use simple HTML and it still gives you exactly the same thing that you expect to.</p>

<p>Framework7 comes with a bunch of ready to use UI elements and widgets like action sheet side panels, popup, popover, media lists, modals, list views, form elements, tabs, layout grid, etc and most of it doesn&rsquo;t require Javascript.</p>

<p>Moreover, popular apps such as Series Seven, Sprint Social, Monday delights were also made using Framework7.</p>

<p><u>Ionic</u></p>

<p>With over 875,000 mobile apps built, Ionic is one of the world&rsquo;s leading mobile app developing framework. It is a free and complete open-source SDK. Ionic offers a library of mobile-optimized CSS, HTML and Java Script components, gestures, and tools for building highly interactive apps.</p>

<p>With minimal, zero jQuery, DOM manipulation and hardware-accelerated transitions, Ionic is built to have an amazing performance and on the latest mobile devices. It also utilizes Angular in order to create a powerful SDK, which is suitable if you want to develop rich and robust applications. One such component provided by the angular is its collection repeats which allows users to scroll through a list of thousands of items without any performance hits. Another such of its component includes scroll-view that creates a scrollable container with which users can interact using a native-influenced system.</p>
