excerpt: "Machine learning is not new topic as many of the algorithms that brought interest in this technology such as Neural Network are the result of decades of research work. The concept of machine learning came into light with pattern recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks. The current growth in machine learning is mainly based on developments in three important areas: Data availability, computing power and innovation of algorithms. Machine Learning thus is a computing intensive and generally requires large amount of training data for repetitive training to improve the learning and decision making of algorithms."
